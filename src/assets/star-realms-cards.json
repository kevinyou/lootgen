So, if you don’t want to scrap the card, just don’t use the ally ability. <b>Powerful Backing</b> The player currently taking their turn counts as having two extra cards of each faction in play that turn for triggering their ally and double ally abilities. <b>Patience Rewarded</b> Like with all cards where each player makes a choice, start with the player currently taking their turn and proceed clockwise.",
